	<p>If you haven't already seen it, there is a new email option on your profile page. Of course this is completely
	optional, but if you want to recieve notifications when you get attacked, get a contract, recieve cbill donations, etc.
	then go ahead and put in your email. Email is not visible to anyone for your privacy. Abuse of the email notifications
	will result in a ban from the league.</p><br>

	<h2 class='white'>I Want To Stream Your Game!</h2><br>

	<p>I'm hoping that sometime this week (March 18th-25th) I can do commentary on an exciting game! There is so much at stake
	and so much intensity in Proxis League games and I want to show it. If your team and your opponent's team would like to volunteer
	to be on stream, then send <a href="http://mwomercs.com/forums/user/160085-multitallented/">multitallented</a> a PM.
	Also, if anyone is interested in helping me commentate this game let me know! I think this is the best way we can show this league
	to the community and PGI so let's do it!</p><br>

	<h2 class='white'>Week 1 News - Reign of the Davions</h2><br>

	<p>This week we saw a lot of Unowned planets being claimed, some initial fighting and a lot of new players join the league!<br><br>
	Varmint Company was able to triple their starting 5 planets for a total of 15 planets by attacking Luna Wolves and Jade Wolf while they were
	fighting each other. The early forfiet from Luna Wolves (their dropship was attacking Winfield) enabled Varmint Company to buy extra
	dropships early and secure 2 planets in the attacks with the help of KaoS Legion.<br><br>

	KaoS Legion tops the mercenaries with 2 wins. By pulling together a team of second-rate mechs they were able to barely stretch their cbills
	enough to accept the 2 contracts and leave themselves completely defenseless. Luckily for them it paid off in a big way putting them
	at the top of the leader board.<br><br>

	Jade Wolf has had a rough start, but came away with 3 kills in their neutral tonnage fight with KaoS Legion at the price of losing 2 pilots and 4 mechs.
	Jade Wolf later went on to win their batchall with Luna Wolves by base cap. No kills were had by either side despite Luna Wolves taking a
	significantly lighter drop deck making them the honorable ones. This was a good move on the part of Jade Wolf as they would not have
	gotten any kills in such a fight.<br><br>

	Antares Pirates have had a good start despite entering the league about half way through the week. Moving inconspiciously they were able to
	move around without attracting any attention to themselves while securing some much needed production capability. Sitting at a mere
	29 million cbills, they are in a great position to cause some havoc.</p><br>
